### Authentication

Unless you specify a credential file with `--credential`, this tool uses [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production?hl=en#providing_credentials_to_your_application) as credential source to connect to Spanner databases.  

Please make sure to prepare your credential by `gcloud auth application-default login`.

If you're running spanner-cli in docker container on your local machine, you have to pass local credentials to the container with the following command.

```
docker run -it \
  -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/tmp/credentials.json \
  -v $HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json:/tmp/credentials.json:ro \
  spanner-cli --help
```

## Example

### Interactive mode

```
$ spanner-cli -p myproject -i myinstance -d mydb
Connected.
spanner> CREATE TABLE users (
      ->   id INT64 NOT NULL,
      ->   name STRING(16) NOT NULL,
      ->   active BOOL NOT NULL
      -> ) PRIMARY KEY (id);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (30.60 sec)

spanner> SHOW TABLES;
+----------------+
| Tables_in_mydb |
+----------------+
| users          |
+----------------+
1 rows in set (18.66 msecs)

spanner> INSERT INTO users (id, name, active) VALUES (1, "foo", true), (2, "bar", false);
Query OK, 2 rows affected (5.08 sec)

spanner> SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id ASC;
+----+------+--------+
| id | name | active |
+----+------+--------+
| 1  | foo  | true   |
| 2  | bar  | false  |
+----+------+--------+
2 rows in set (3.09 msecs)

spanner> BEGIN;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

spanner(rw txn)> DELETE FROM users WHERE active = false;
Query OK, 1 rows affected (0.61 sec)

spanner(rw txn)> COMMIT;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.20 sec)

spanner> SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id ASC;
+----+------+--------+
| id | name | active |
+----+------+--------+
| 1  | foo  | true   |
+----+------+--------+
1 rows in set (2.58 msecs)

spanner> DROP TABLE users;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (25.20 sec)

spanner> SHOW TABLES;
Empty set (2.02 msecs)

spanner> EXIT;
Bye
```

### Batch mode

By passing SQL from standard input, `spanner-cli` runs in batch mode.

```
$ echo 'SELECT * FROM users;' | spanner-cli -p myproject -i myinstance -d mydb
id      name    active
1       foo     true
2       bar     false
```

You can also pass SQL with command line option `-e`.

```
$ spanner-cli -p myproject -i myinstance -d mydb -e 'SELECT * FROM users;'
id      name    active
1       foo     true
2       bar     false
```

With `-t` option, results are displayed in table format.

```
$ spanner-cli -p myproject -i myinstance -d mydb -e 'SELECT * FROM users;' -t
+----+------+--------+
| id | name | active |
+----+------+--------+
| 1  | foo  | true   |
| 2  | bar  | false  |
+----+------+--------+
```

### Directed reads mode

spanner-cli now supports directed reads, a feature that allows you to read data from a specific replica of a Spanner database. 
To use directed reads with spanner-cli, you need to specify the `--directed-read` flag.
The `--directed-read` flag takes a single argument, which is the name of the replica that you want to read from.
The replica name can be specified in one of the following formats:

- `<replica_location>`
- `<replica_location>:<replica_type>`

The `<replica_location>` specifies the region where the replica is located such as `us-central1`, `asia-northeast2`.  
The `<replica_type>` specifies the type of the replica either `READ_WRITE` or `READ_ONLY`. 
 
```
$ spanner-cli -p myproject -i myinstance -d mydb --directed-read us-central1

$ spanner-cli -p myproject -i myinstance -d mydb --directed-read us-central1:READ_ONLY

$ spanner-cli -p myproject -i myinstance -d mydb --directed-read asia-northeast2:READ_WRITE
```

Directed reads are only effective for single queries or queries within a read-only transaction.
Please note that directed read options do not apply to queries within a read-write transaction.

> [!NOTE]
> If you specify an incorrect region or type for directed reads, directed reads will not be enabled and [your requsts won't be routed as expected](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/directed-reads#parameters). For example, in a multi-region configuration `nam3`, if you mistype `us-east1` as `us-east-1`, the connection will succeed, but directed reads will not be enabled. 
>
> To perform directed reads to `asia-northeast2` in a multi-region configuration `asia1`, you need to specify `asia-northeast2` or `asia-northeast2:READ_WRITE`.
> Since the replicas placed in `asia-northeast2` are READ_WRITE replicas, directed reads will not be enabled if you specify `asia-northeast2:READ_ONLY`.
> 
> Please refer to [the Spanner documentation](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/instance-configurations#available-configurations-multi-region) to verify the valid configurations.

## Syntax

In the following syntax, we use `<>` for a placeholder, `[]` for an optional keyword,
and `{}` for a mutually exclusive keyword.

* The syntax is case-insensitive.
* `\G` delimiter is also supported for displaying results vertically.

| Usage | Syntax | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |

| Create table | `CREATE TABLE ...;` | |
| Change table schema | `ALTER TABLE ...;` | |
| Delete table | `DROP TABLE ...;` | |
| Truncate table | `TRUNCATE TABLE <table>;` | Only rows are deleted. Note: Non-atomically because executed as a [partitioned DML statement](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/dml-partitioned?hl=en). |

| Delete index | `DROP INDEX ...;` | |
| Create role | `CREATE ROLE ...;` | |
| Drop role | `DROP ROLE ...;` | |
| Grant | `GRANT ...;` | |
| Revoke | `REVOKE ...;` | |
| Query | `SELECT ...;` | |
| DML | `{INSERT\|UPDATE\|DELETE} ...;` | |
| Partitioned DML | `PARTITIONED {UPDATE\|DELETE} ...;` | |
| Show Query Execution Plan | `EXPLAIN SELECT ...;` | |
| Show DML Execution Plan | `EXPLAIN {INSERT\|UPDATE\|DELETE} ...;` | |

| Start Read-Write Transaction | `BEGIN [RW] [PRIORITY {HIGH\|MEDIUM\|LOW}] [TAG <tag>];` | See [Request Priority](#request-priority) for details on the priority. The tag you set is used as both transaction tag and request tag. See also [Transaction Tags and Request Tags](#transaction-tags-and-request-tags).|
| Commit Read-Write Transaction | `COMMIT;` | |
| Rollback Read-Write Transaction | `ROLLBACK;` | |
| Start Read-Only Transaction | `BEGIN RO [{<seconds>\|<RFC3339-formatted time>}] [PRIORITY {HIGH\|MEDIUM\|LOW}] [TAG <tag>];` | `<seconds>` and `<RFC3339-formatted time>` is used for stale read. See [Request Priority](#request-priority) for details on the priority. The tag you set is used as request tag. See also [Transaction Tags and Request Tags](#transaction-tags-and-request-tags).|
| End Read-Only Transaction | `CLOSE;` | |
| Exit CLI | `EXIT;` | |

## Customize prompt

You can customize the prompt by `--prompt` option.  
There are some defined variables for being used in prompt.

Variables:

* `\p` : GCP Project ID
* `\i` : Cloud Spanner Instance ID
* `\d` : Cloud Spanner Database ID
* `\t` : In transaction

Example:

```
$ spanner-cli -p myproject -i myinstance -d mydb --prompt='[\p:\i:\d]\t> '
Connected.
[myproject:myinstance:mydb]> SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id ASC;
+----+------+--------+
| id | name | active |
+----+------+--------+
| 1  | foo  | true   |
| 2  | bar  | false  |
+----+------+--------+
2 rows in set (3.09 msecs)

[myproject:myinstance:mydb]> begin;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.08 sec)

[myproject:myinstance:mydb](rw txn)> ...
```

The default prompt is `spanner\t> `.

## Config file

This tool supports a configuration file called `spanner_cli.cnf`, similar to `my.cnf`.  
The config file path must be `~/.spanner_cli.cnf`.  
In the config file, you can set default option values for command line options.

Example:

```conf
[spanner]
project = myproject
instance = myinstance
prompt = "[\\p:\\i:\\d]\\t> "
```

## Configuration Precedence

1. Command line flags(highest)
2. Environment variables
3. `.spanner_cli.cnf` in current directory
4. `.spanner_cli.cnf` in home directory(lowest)

## Request Priority

You can set [request priority](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/reference/rest/v1/RequestOptions#Priority) for command level or transaction level.
By default `MEDIUM` priority is used for every request.

To set a priority for command line level, you can use `--priority={HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW}` command line option.

To set a priority for transaction level, you can use `PRIORITY {HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW}` keyword.

Here are some examples for transaction-level priority.

```
# Read-write transaction with low priority
BEGIN PRIORITY LOW;

# Read-only transaction with low priority
BEGIN RO PRIORITY LOW;

# Read-only transaction with 60s stale read and medium priority
BEGIN RO 60 PRIORITY MEDIUM;

# Read-only transaction with exact timestamp and medium priority
BEGIN RO 2021-04-01T23:47:44+00:00 PRIORITY MEDIUM;
```

Note that transaction-level priority takes precedence over command-level priority.

## Transaction Tags and Request Tags

In a read-write transaction, you can add a tag following `BEGIN RW TAG <tag>`.
spanner-cli adds the tag set in `BEGIN RW TAG` as a transaction tag.
The tag will also be used as request tags within the transaction.

```
# Read-write transaction
# transaction_tag = tx1
+--------------------+
| BEGIN RW TAG tx1;  |
|                    |
| SELECT val         |
| FROM tab1      +-----request_tag = tx1
| WHERE id = 1;      |
|                    |
| UPDATE tab1        |
| SET val = 10   +-----request_tag = tx1
| WHERE id = 1;      |
|                    |
| COMMIT;            |
+--------------------+
```

In a read-only transaction, you can add a tag following `BEGIN RO TAG <tag>`.
Since read-only transaction doesn't support transaction tag, spanner-cli adds the tag set in `BEGIN RO TAG` as request tags.
```
# Read-only transaction
# transaction_tag = N/A
+--------------------+
| BEGIN RO TAG tx2;  |
|                    |
| SELECT SUM(val)    |
| FROM tab1      +-----request_tag = tx2
| WHERE id = 1;      |
|                    |
| CLOSE;             |
+--------------------+
```

## Using with the Cloud Spanner Emulator

This tool supports the [Cloud Spanner Emulator](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/emulator) via the [`SPANNER_EMULATOR_HOST` environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/emulator#client-libraries).

```sh
$ export SPANNER_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:9010
# Or with gcloud env-init:
$ $(gcloud emulators spanner env-init)

$ spanner-cli -p myproject -i myinstance -d mydb
```
